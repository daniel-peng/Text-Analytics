If you re in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out  have a few drinks  indulge in some delicious food  and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your  must try  list. Afterwards  walk next door to Churn and order up some homemade ice cream or purchase a few throwback candy items. It s all a part of the experience anyway  right? Enjoy!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I adore El Bravo!I admit that I may be biased because I ve been going here since the early 90 s when I was just a wee child and thus this place is quite nostalgic for me  but no matter. It was literally 5 minutes away from the house I grew up in  so my family would come here at least once a month.The food is great-and relatively cheap-no  it s not Filly B s (eww!) cheap  but it s certainly affordable  even for a broke college student like me. I almost always order the same thing--a bean and cheese burro with an extra flour tortilla--since I don t eat red meat or chicken (and because I m a creature of habit). Their cheese crisp is also amazing-basic  but delicious. Good chips and salsa (chips are pretty good-thin  but good- but the salsa is GREAT!) Yes  they do charge for them  but I suspect they would be inundated with homeless people looking for free chips and salsa otherwise  since it s not exactly in the greatest neighborhood (Sunnyslope  represent!). I ve heard their navajo tacos and green corn tamales are top-notch  as are their machaca burros  according to my (non-veggie) friends and family. Their flour tortillas rock. I m very picky about my tortillas  and these are the best I ve tried here. They re leaps and bounds above the famous Carolina s tortillas  far superior to Via Delosantos (which is just a mediocre restaurant overall  IMO)  and not even in the same category as tortillas from the chain restaurants like Manuel s or Macayo s. Their desserts are great  too  and the free cinnamon crisp-y things they give you with your bill are very tasty. Now  what I DON T like about El Bravo:1) Hours: I m a night owl. Please stay open later  EB! They close at 8 on weekdays and 8:30 on Fridays and Saturdays (I believe)  and are closed on Sundays. I would really prefer if they stayed open until at least 9 on weekdays and 9:30 on weekends-I often don t get off work until 7:30  and I work 30 minutes away  so I can never come here on days that I work  which is unfortunate. I m not asking them to turn into delux  but really-8 is waaaayyy too early to close. 2) Small parking lot. Not really their fault  but if you go on a weekend  you may have to park across the street. 3) Service. It can either be friendly and speedy (on a slow weekday night)  or friendly yet slow as molasses (on a busy weekend night). I ve gone there so much that the servers (there s only a couple of them that work there) usually remember me. Wish they had more staff so the service was better on weekends. Alas.Overall  though  I love El Bravo-simple  no-frills  and utterly delicious.</th>\n",

Nice and juicy perfect size to split into two. I was happy by coming here  you always know what to expect. The buns are nice and fresh and the selection of toppings is wonderful.

Yes  it s a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes  there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won t appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes  the portions tend to be on the  enormous  side so if you re watching your waistline  plan on splitting a meal. But rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be  til way after you re gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib  when you arrive early enough  is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you d find a better  more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you ll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.If you re a newbie to Texas Grill - it s good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don t get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you ll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you ll have to earn it.There s not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it s not on the menu) and you ll have one of the best burgers in town. If you re a party of one or there s a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic  but you ll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).When visitors come to town  you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam  downtown for urban cool  and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food  you can t beat Texaz.

       "      <th>China Village  I would like to award you 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are in love with you. Absolutely our go-to Chinese restaurant. Why do I love it so much? Well... The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there  that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny  and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said  I don t want to take away from the other people that work there  because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff.They start you off with complimentary hot tea and water. It s good tea too. It s unsweetened  but if you are like my boyfriend and need it sweet  there is sugar available of course. However  I like it as is.The food itself is wonderful. The first time I went  I had a spicy shrimp dish  served with steamed white rice. It had the perfect amount of kick  and there was just enough to fill me up and and then some to take home to enjoy later. My personal favorite dish though is the beef and broccoli. Definitely a classic  but the broccoli is always the perfect texture  and the sauce is so rich and the beef is always great  for this dish. Usually we get the dinner combination that comes with a bowl of soup (also good)  a crab puff  a chicken wing  and an egg roll. I usually trade my boyfriend the eggroll for the chicken wing  because they are each of our favorites. This place is great for a weeknight dinner out..... Well  really any dinner out  I m gonna be honest. Or lunch for that matter. Actually  whenever you want to eat out  just go here :)</th>\n",

I was out of ideas for good food so I asked my sister in law and she recommended this place  so i rolled the dice and took her to Windsor  it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was just right for a date  not awkwardly silent  but not too loud to have a nice conversation. The menu was manageable  yet still had something for everyone. She had the veggie stack  which sounds terrible to me and loved it. I got the loaded chips  a hot dog  and macaroni and cheese (I felt like eating like a 9 year old... an overweight 9 year old).  It was delicious. The service was great too  not one thing to complain about.I give the credit for this successful date to Windsor. Needless to say I have already locked in another date. I will be going back.</th>\n",

       "      <th>The following is written by me  one of Richardson Browne s biggest supporters and fans. This is an absolute 100% carbon copy of Richardson s. The window coverings  adobe booths  throw pillows  copper bar top  teal awnings  eclectic mix of soft rock  and even the prickly pear margiratas. The feel and atmosphere are almost the same. They even serve meals on big metal plates  often times with tortillas under them. Anyone who thinks this place is original needs to go see Richardson immediately.All that aside  the food here is really good. I ordered the Carne Adovada which came a little drier than what I m used to a Rich s place  which was a welcome change as they really let the pecan wood smoked pork speak for itself. The tortilla accompanying the dish was not tearable  but rather so dried out that it broke when I tried to tear it. This was the only dissappointment of the dish. Beans and rice were identical to Richardson s  smokey and delicious. The girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas  which to her surprise were the Red  White  and Blue Enchiladas from Richardsons. One chicken  one shrimp  and one cheese  wrapped in different colored tortillas smothered in green sauce. They were very much exactly what we were used to.All in all  I d say that Barbara  the owner  probably is using the same recipes and has obviously used the same formula here. She is doing a great job  and I will go back if I am ever in this part of town again. Even with the prices on the menu being about 20% less  it s not worth a 35 minute drive for me.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I was fooled.  The unassuming strip mall exterior and the fact that it shares a wall partition with a blech sister restaurant (Tokyo Express) had me fooled.  Even the overwhelmingly positive reviews didn t inspire me to go.  But make no mistake  this place is fantastic. I am embarrassed to say that I only ended up here because Lola and Padres (Oregano s was too long of a wait) were both closed on Sunday night -- and I pass by this place all the time.Really good noodles and pasta done Asian Fusion style and totally cheap.  The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that s not your thang  they have rice bowls  sushi  salads  about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.You ll find that they have an open kitchen so if you re close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else s food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it. My favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?  Wtf  whew  that came out of left field.  An awesome and delicious surprise that was.They had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special.  Did you hear that?  HALF OFF!!  All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes  it s official.  I m easy.When I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.  Only then  did everything in life make sense.  Lesson:  Sketchy looking strip mall restaurant does not equal dump. P.S.  The tiny parking lot gets crowded very quickly and street parking with Oregano s next door can be problematic.</th>\n",

It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it s some of the best cornbread I ve ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it s free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla  bananas foster french toast (very sweet)  and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren t a ton of items on the brunch menu  but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed. The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food  and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can t ask for more than that. The only reason Z Tejas isn t 5 stars is because is doesn t have that jaw dropping  wow  factor with any of the dishes we ve tried yet...it does have the  mmm...that s realllly good  factor going on...but not quite the  Arrrrgggh  I m gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure  factor.

       "      <th>It took me a while finding Dick s Hideaway.  It s nestled between some smaller businesses across the way from a strip mall  and I didn t see a sign over the door until I decided to get out of the car and find it on foot.  The doors were nothing fancy  and there wasn t an outdoor menu to check out  but I later figured after I had eaten my meal that if Dick s cared to advertise  there d ultimately be lines down the block of people waiting for a seat at their three tables  or their bar.Whether waiting for the good drinks  the cozy atmosphere  the amazing food  the kind service  or a chance to watch your meal being made over a fresh draught beer  there d be people waiting.  I am thankful that Dick s is such a hard place to find  and even happier knowing it s certainly worth the search.Dick s menu is strictly American.  Good American.  They only have one burger stowed away on three menu pages bristling with bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp  roasted chicken and cheese steak sandwiches.  Just one burger  and yet I d not want another to take the place of every other delicious option you ll find.  In fact  if there s anything wrong with the menu at Dick s  it s that there are too many amazing plates to choose from.  I ended up having half my drink before I found what I wanted  but the service was quick  attentive  and ready when I pointed out the cheese steak and watched it made fresh.Sure  there are only three tables.  You can order food at the bar  if you re lucky enough to score a stool.  But I can t dock Dick a star for being a hard-to-get treat.  If there were more tables it d feel too big.  It d be louder  full of people who take the place for granted.  No  Dick -- keep it small.  It s quaint  personable  and OHMYGOD delicious.  If I was made to wait half an hour for a chance to enjoy a meal at Dick s  it d be well worth it.</th>\n",

For dinner I ordered the grilled burrito and it almost tasted like something I could pull from my freezer and make in the microwave. There wasn t much inside other than beans and cheese - hello  what about the guac  sour cream  and salsas?!?! The slaw was not exciting either. The portions are gigantic but if the foods not very good it s hard to make a dent in your plate. Luckily we ordered a ticoz salad as well and it was hardier and more colorful than the specialty entrees. If it hadn t been for the Passionfruit sangria I would have given this place 2 stars because I was so disappointed. The sangria was perfectly sweet and winey at the same time - filled with fruit and so easy to drink I had to drink 2 cups before I realized I was kind of tipsy. They also offer 3 other sangria flavors but the waiter recommended the passionfruit.In conclusion  I would solely recommend this place for drinks and snacks. They have a lounge area on the opposite side of the seated restaurant area that would be perfect for happy hour hang outs with friends.</th>\n",

So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out  but it was awful. Glad I didn t pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor  the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! My other pick was potato skins  I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them  $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves  all the size of a child s palm! I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it  seriously. It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee s food is much  much better and not as expensive! To Applebee s I ll return but to the HRC  this is my last visit. Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback  if I remember the street correctly. The building &amp; bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too  I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. Before this stop at the HRC  I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC  I withdraw my support of you.</th>\n",

Oh the food: I started with miso soup and edamame (both hard to mess up)  they were good. I ordered a tempura shrimp roll...it was okay  the end pieces had the parts you don t eat so there were only like four pieces.  Overall it was okay and one of the only sushi places by my office (now that I work nearby) so I ll probably be back.

When I first saw the bocce court  it was jarring...like walking by the sushi bar at Houston s...just because you can doesn t mean you should. But  someone near the top of the Chilada family may  in fact  be a marketing genius! That thing really got a workout while we were there the other day.The Beautiful Carin and I hadn t been back to Tia Chilada s in a year or so  but we needed to reconnoiter...my strong and handsome son  Zachary and his lovely wife  Sarah are visiting next week and they want to go (good memories of another great visit:)We wandered in at happy hour (absolutely the best time to visit the Chilada family). Lots of people drinking  eating chips and salsa  etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?). We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area  so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:)The people watching at Aunt Chilada s is wonderful..all walks of life  all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita s and cheaper cerveza:) It s a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested  uptight (I know  a word right out of the 60 s) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed  slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world. So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita s under his belt  trying to bowl the bocce s. It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury  but I think he managed it:)The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada s:)Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga  and I had something called a tortillion (which  interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish  reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef  cheese  beans  tomatoes  bacon (bacon!!!!)  wrapped in a giant tortilla  dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was  but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge  growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:)Nope  it s not the best Mexican restaurant in town  and it s not the best bocce court you ll ever see  but combined  they make Aunt Chilada s a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail  and to play the games that people play:)</th>\n",

       "      <th>I really wanted to love this place. I had initially seen this place on groupon then read reviews and the menu and was excited to try it. Its a type of atmosphere I like in a restaurant  very modern  and nicely appointed. This ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. I m generally pretty easy to please and very forgiving of little issues of a restaurant. This place missed on just about every aspect.We went at about 4:30 for a late lunch and happy hour. We sat in the lounge and greeted fairly promptly. Drink orders were taken. A little stingy on the pours of their wine. The Sangria  both red and white were tasty. The red Sangria had quite the kick. That was the best part of the evening. After asking for one more minute to browse the menu before ordering our server vanished. It was nearly 20 minutes before having to step up to the bar to ask to order food. We ordered a mix of items as I love to try lots of items from a new place. We ordered the burger  2 different tacos  crab croquettes  and the meatballs. Most of which are small plate items. The tacos are very small and do not come on a white corn tortilla. I m not quite sure what it was. I was not a fan. I hardly noticed that their was shrimp in the one taco. I only noticed from looking  it was not from tasting it. The skirt steak in the second taco was tender and flavorful. The crab croquettes and typical of bar food. You could taste the crab  not in a sweet Maryland style crab cake kind of way. It was more like a tuna fish casserole sort of taste. The burger was decent  but definitely not worthy of a $12 price tag. I have had larger Wagyu beef hamburgers for the same price that tasted so much better. The fries with the burger are good and the house made ketchup is great. The last item of what we ordered was the meatballs. Its a cute presentation with triangles of toast for dipping in the bland sauce. Unfortunately the meatballs were uncooked in the center. Not just undercooked and pink  they were RAW on the inside. I sent the dish back of course. The waitress was very apologetic and took them off the bill. As she was trying to clear the table she dropped some silverware and food at our feet. By this time she obviously was not having a good day. She brought us a complimentary dessert of a pumpkin cupcake with ice cream. The ice cream was great. The cupcake was overcooked and dry. When the bill arrived I gave my groupon and credit card to the server. The manager came back with both and apologized for bad experience and comped the whole bill. I m not sure if I would try them again. The problems with the meal were very basic things that just should never happen at a restaurant of this level.</th>\n",

       "      <th>So.... this place is ridiculously overpriced. I went last night with the Bf and a couple friends. We wanted to get a couple beers and have some food. First of all  they do not list any prices for beers.... I think they should probably do that considering how ridiculously expensive their beer is. We asked the server for prices and she said  They start around 4$ and then go up from there depending on the beer with an average of around 6$  Well... that s not really so helpful. I ordered the rose gaarden which is hoegaarden mixed with framboise lambic... it was good  until I found out it was almost 9$..... for a beer? What? That is the most expensive beer I have ever had. Our food was alright  but also ridiculously priced. I got the summer salad (strawberries  avocado  romaine  mandarin oranges from a can and balsamic). It was fine  but pretty small for a 9$ appetizer salad. Oh and if you want chicken on it  it s an extra 5$ or so.... that must be some amazing chicken. You can t get an entree salad or sandwich for less than 10$. I did get a cup clam chowder too  and it was not great and kind of luke warm when I got it... meh. Everyone else got sandwiches and said they were fine  but nothing special. I feel like just because the place has a lot of beers on tap does not mean they should charge double what anywhere else sells the same beers for. So anyway  for a sandwich  a salad  and 5 beers  our bill came out to about 65$. That will never ever happen again. I could go to a nice local non-chain restaurant in the valley and get better food for that kind of money  which is what I suggest everyone does.</th>\n",

I m going to have to say  No ...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking  I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be  Donnie Downer  so let s start with some positives from the brunch the other day:* There was no screaming  whatsoever:)* The service was outstanding...no really  our server was excellent  and friendly  as well as knowledgeable and competent:)* They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)* They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)* The menu is reasonably creative:)On the other hand (oh  you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn t be that everything was great)* The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the  signature  dish  as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry  the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good  though and if the pork hadn t been dry and if the potatoes were done  I could see this dish being a solid choice:)* $25 for two vodka martini s on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don t like to complain about prices  generally  but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti s at oh  say AZ88  yet they cost more. That doesn t make me happy:(I just haven t had the best of luck with places named  Dick s  anything...Dickey s BBQ is just a pit and Dickie s Dog s apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.The Richardson s Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front  so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.But I probably won t be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell s Kitchen and want to catch up:)</th>\n",

Everything seemed just a little too commercialized to me which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4.Their Sake menu is reason enough to go back  but be prepared to spend a little. It is a tapas only  we ordered 6 tapas between two of us just to feel satisfied. The cheapest tapas on their menu are about 4 or 5 bucks  but there s only 2 or 3 things that are that cheap  and I think they were mostly the vegetarian tapas. Most of the tapas seemed to average out at about 7 bucks. So with sake and tip  you probably average out at about $40 a person. I would definitely suggest getting a side of rice to help fill your belly.They did an awesome job of atmosphere in the restaurant  and Johnny Chu came out several times to make sure we were enjoying our food. They also had a D.J. who did a great job of choosing GOOD music to play while we ate.  I m just not sure that the timing was right for them  not very many people in downtown are quite ready for a place like this on a regular basis.

       "      <th>How many Uzbeki Jewish restaurants have you been to recently? Yeah  I thought so. Well  if you re ever curious  here s your chance  right here in Phoenix.Samarkand is in a nondescript strip mall (isn t this how I describe every other restaurant in Phoenix?) on 19th Ave just south of Northern. Curious about this joint the countless times I ve driven by it  I finally decided to head there for lunch one day.The family that runs the place is speaking in Russian in the back and all of a sudden stops and looks at me. No other customer is in here besides myself  which is fine. The wife comes forwards  greets me warmly  and hands me the menu. I survey the surroundings. Photos of the blue domed mosques that Samarkand is famous for. A disco ball hanging from the ceiling  because sometimes you just have to put down your peroshki and party. A television set is on  tuned into (from what I can tell) the Russian equivalent of the Home Shopping Network. At this current moment  Svetlana is hawking a cyclonic vacuum cleaner. I try my best to make sense of the Cyrillic captions  but I give up. And then there  on the far wall  a grand painting of Moses parting the Red Sea. It all comes together.The wife comes back. I ask her that I want to try traditional Uzbeki food. She looks at me as if I have a learning disability  but in a motherly way.  It is all traditional food.  Yeah  ok. I knew that.I haven t had borscht in ages  so I order a bowl of it. I also order a lipioshka  which is traditional Uzbek bread. It looks like a giant danish in a way: it s round  with a thick fluffy outer ring and and thinner center  sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. And to round out the meal  a couple skewers of marinated beef sheesh kebabs.While my hostess goes back to the kitchen  I play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with the Russian soap opera which has just begun. I get into it.Sergei:  Natasha  I knew you were lying the moment you said you were going to go to the Gorky Park concert. Because  really  who goes to a Gorky Park concert in 2007 Moscow? They only play  Bang! Bang!  in gypsy carnivals in Vladivostok.  Natasha:  Nyet  Sergei. I did go to the Gorky Park concert. In front of the Red Square McDonalds. I am the president of their fan club. We have 3 members. But Sergei  my name is not Natasha. I m Ludmilla. Who is this Natasha? TELL ME  WHO IS THIS NATASHA?! Answer me!  *slap*Before I get too carried off in my head  the food arrives. The borscht is a lot more brothy than I was expecting. Don t get me wrong  it s still good  but I was expecting a thick  deep purple soup. I ll chalk that up to mostly eating Russian food cooked by Russian friends of mine. The soup still has ample shreds of beets and carrots though. And even though sour cream and I aren t the best of friends these days  I would have taken one for the team and put some in my soup to bring out the flavor. But there was no sour cream brought to my table.However  the bread  this lipioshka  was awesome. The various tastes and textures between the outer ring and the center was great  and perfect for dunking a bit of it into my soup. I could have ordered a few of these and that could have been my entire lunch  no complaints.About 10 minutes later  the skewers arrived. Very unadorned - they were exactly as advertised: two skewers of beef. And that s it. I was expecting great things  but somehow I was a little underwhelmed. The beef tasted a little gamy to me  but maybe it s how it should be and I haven t acquired the taste yet. I don t know. On the plus side  it was really juicy and cooked just right.All in all  though  I d say it was worth the trip. The lipioshka alone merits a few more visits. Service is friendly  and I m guessing the main crowd comes in for dinner and subsequent partying under the disco ball  because I was the only customer they had at lunchtime. Which is a good thing  I guess  because A) you have their undivided attention and B) when you don t  you have Sergei and Ludmilla (not Natasha) to entertain you. 3 stars. May increase with future trips.</th>\n",

If you ve read any of my Paradise Bakery reviews  you d know that s not a compliment by any means.  Whomever dreamed up the concept of this quick service restaurant really didn t think things through.The counter is a complete cluster.  There s monitors with videos playing that blocks the menu board.  So if you don t know what you want  you need to grab a paper menu.  Pretty awkward for a first timer.  Standing in a big group of people steering at menus also was an unexpected and uncomfortable experience.   I then ordered my sandwich and a salad at the left end of the counter  navigated my way around the people waiting for soups  past the dessert counter (desserts actually looked awesome  so I d bet they were not made on sight)  then to the registers.  Retold the order I just made but was still waiting on to the cashier.  Then I had a brief wait for my food at the register.  I usually am not a big fan of the take a number system.  But that would be very helpful at this place.  Also  some sort of a ticket to hand the cashier or a register at the same place you order would be nice as well.The food wasn t very good.  The summer chicken salad was short on toppings.  Plenty of lettuce  a decent amount of fruit  but only a few pieces of chicken. The french bread from any nearby supermarket would have been tastier than what they offered on the side.  The chicken pesto panini wasn t very flavorful or filling.  While the entrees are cheap  you re going to have to shell out for the sides if you want a complete meal.There are so many fast food options in the district of Desert Ridge Marketplace.

After about ten minutes  the same gentleman (aka busboy) said he would be taking our orders.* We were told there would be a choice of four potato preparations  but were not asked to specify. What arrived were some enormous mounds of very sad  mashed  potatoes- there was at least a quarter of a whole potato on my plate that seemed to escape the masher!* We both ordered med-rare beef medallions  but the butchering was terrible: my medallions were plump and lovely  my husband s duplicate order looked more like thin cutlets.* Our actual waiter stopped by the table and introduced himself midway through our entrees  which  by the way  looked like they were plated for a cafeteria.Complaints aside (and there are a lot  I know!)  the beef was delicious  the bartender was friendly and efficient despite the standing room only conditions  and the valet was literally running to make parking smooth and hassle-free.I left feedback on Opentable.com and  to Donovan s credit  received a polite and prompt response with an offer to make amends.</th>\n",

This time we placed our order  received our drinks  ate our dinner salads  and then (a full 30 minutes after we placed the order) the server informed me that they were out of gluten-free pasta.

The server informed me that I was charged an  extra  $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here  because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!

We ordered  and waited and waited. Our waitress had another table that she was far more interested in than us and our service was subpar  a disppointment considering how excited we were to be there.
